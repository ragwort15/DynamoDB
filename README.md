Reflection: While doing this assingment I learned about the DynamoDB table and lambda function. I learnt to write a lambda function with the CRUD operations. (GET, PUT, POST , DELETE). However I faced some challeges while sending the GET request due to permissions issue.
Also it was challenging to create a lambda functions with all the CRUD opeartions.
